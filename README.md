# My first website

This is a repo for the project I did in XML for Publishing in 2015. It was the first website I ever made so it sucks but I'm still a bit happy about it since I learnt so much. Since the website is a blog and was the first project I made which incorporated everything from database to the client. 

It is hosted on Heroku at [https://old-kth-php-blog.herokuapp.com/](https://old-kth-php-blog.herokuapp.com/)
